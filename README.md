# password-generator
Simple password generator made in C++.

## How to use
First, install these dependencies:
- CMake (at least version 3.22)
- make (if you're using Linux)
- GCC (if you're using Linux, at least version 11.2.0)
- Microsoft Visual Studio (if you're using Windows, but GCC can be used on Windows as well)

Next use CMake to build the Makefiles (or Visual Studio Solution files if you're on Windows):

```
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
```

You can use CMake's GUI as well.

Then use `make` (on Linux) or `Visual Studio` (on Windows) to compile the password generator:

Linux:
```
& make
```

Windows:
Unfortunately I do not have Windows so I cannot show you how to build the .exe file, but I'm sure you can do it yourself :)
